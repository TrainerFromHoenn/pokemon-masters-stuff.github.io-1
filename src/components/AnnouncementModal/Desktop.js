            1. You can now select sync levels and the grids will change
            accordingly. Also added to url so other people with the link will
            see the same thing
            <br />
            2. Further shortened url. Thanks to u/f3xjc for teaching me how to
            b64 encode!

            Added multi-language support for UI. Credit to Jo from Discord for
            the Italian translations. He also abbreviated all the Italian skill

            For the other languages I relied on Google Translate. If you see any
            mistranslation, you can help me correct it by editing this Google
